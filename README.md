# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in mardkdown allow us to **copy, plaste and share core**. A goog Cloud Engineer uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks (`), you can find it here in the keyboard, also here
- Not to be confused with quotation (')

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```
this is another one
